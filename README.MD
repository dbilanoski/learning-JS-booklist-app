## General info
In my learningJS series here on Git Hub I will showcase simple applications built mostly as a practice while learning JavaScript. Here I explore Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript - first I created application using standard (ES5) syntax after which I translated code to ES6 syntax with classes. 

Booklist app enables you to catalog your books - it takes three parameters for each insert - title, author and ISBN. Applicaton stores your list data to Local storage and enables you to manipulate your data - delete items and filter list.
